            Daily Adventure Box Terms and Conditions of Use
        </h1>

        <div class="text-sm mb-5">
            By renting, accessing or using outdoor equipment ("Equipment") from Daily Adventure Box, Inc. ("DAB"), You
            agree to all of the Terms and Conditions of Use (the "Terms") below:
        </div>

        <ol class="text-sm mb-4 pl-6">
            <li>
                <b>Rental:</b> You (the DAB "Customer" or "You") agree to rent the Equipment from DAB for the duration of time
                selected and paid for at your time of rental (the "Rental Period").
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fees:</b> In addition to all amounts due under any other provision(s) of this contract, You agree to pay DAB
                the all fees set forth in the DAB mobile application (the "App"), including subscription, rental and
                supplemental fees (collectively, "DAB Fees"), without reduction or setoff, for the Rental Period. If You
                fail to return any Equipment when it is Due, You will incur additional fees ("Late Fees") as set forth
                in the App until the Equipment is returned to, and accepted by, DAB. (Note: DAB may, in its sole
                discretion, increase or impose fees related to late and non-returns from time to time based upon factors
                including, but not limited to, volume of other renter requests to use Equipment, seasonality, and time
                of day).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Payment Authorization:</b> Subject to such limitations as may be set forth in applicable law, You
                irrevocably and unconditionally authorize Us to immediately charge the credit card or other payment
                method You have provided to Us for all DAB Fees and associated charges due under these Terms. You
                further agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless DAB with respect to all such payments, processing
                fees, and related charges.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cancellation:</b> If you cancel two hours or more in advance of your Equipment pick-up time, there is no
                charge. If you cancel less than two hours in advance of your pick-up time, you will be charged fifty
                percent (50%) of the DAB Fees.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Possession/Title:</b> DAB owns the Equipment, and title in and to all of it will remain with DAB at all
                times.  You are entitled to use and possess the Equipment for the Rental Period, subject to the terms of
                the Terms. If you retain any of the Equipment beyond the length of time selected and paid for via the
                DAB App, You will be deemed to have materially breached these Terms.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Warranty Waiver:</b> All DAB Equipment is provided "as-is" and "with all faults." We make no warranty,
                express or implied (including without limitation, any and all warranties of suitability, merchantability
                and/or fitness for any particular purpose), nor do we make any warranty against interference,
                infringement, that the Equipment is fit for your intended use, application or environment, or that it is
                free from defects (latent or patent). No warranties shall be deemed to exist with respect to the
                equipment. Your sole remedy for any failure of or defect in or with respect to any of the Equipment is
                termination of the accrual of subscription or rental fees at the time of failure.
            </li>

                inspect, examine and accept the Equipment in the condition rented, and that, as delivered to You, it is
                safe and in good operating condition and repair and otherwise in all ways acceptable to you. If,
                following such inspection and examination, you do not accept the Equipment for use in the condition
                available, you will not us the Equipment, will immediately return the Equipment, and will immediately

            <li>
                <b>Use of Equipment:</b> The equipment is authorized for use only by You and Your agents and authorized users,
                each of whom must be skilled, experienced, trained and authorized in use of the Equipment in its normal,
                intended use.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Loss or Damage:</b> You are the insurer of the Equipment during the Rental Term. You bear all risk of loss,
                theft, damage or destruction to the Equipment, regardless of cause (ordinary wear and tear excepted). If
                the Equipment is lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed during the Rental Term, whether or not the same is
                Your fault, You will notify Us immediately, and You will pay DAB the retail value of the parts and labor
                necessary to repair the Equipment if damaged, or its replacement cost, if lost, stolen, destroyed or
                damaged beyond DAB's reasonable ability to repair it; and in either case, all packing, shipping,
                handling, storage and other associated costs. Rent previously paid will not be applied to the
                above-referenced charges.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Return of Equipment:</b> You agree that, upon return to Us, the Equipment will be clean, free of all
                regulated or hazardous substances (including without limitation, substances identified as "hazardous
                materials" under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Toxic Substances Control Act
                (TSCA) and/or any other federal, state or local laws, rules and/or regulations purporting to deal with
                toxic or hazardous substances), rental-ready, and otherwise in substantially the same order condition

                <b>Warning regarding Criminal Conversion:</b> The use of false or fictitious identification or accounts via the
                DAB App to obtain DAB Equipment, the failure to return rental property or the failure to pay for its
                use, is a crime and may result in criminal prosecution in addition to civil penalties.

            <li>
                <b>Waiver of Jury Trial:</b> You hereby waive all rights to a jury trial of any claim or cause of action based

                may discuss this waiver and its effects with legal counsel.  Accordingly, You knowingly, voluntarily,
                irrevocably and unconditionally waive any jury trial rights.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Enforcement:</b> You agree to pay Us all attorneys' fees and other costs DAB may incur in enforcing or
